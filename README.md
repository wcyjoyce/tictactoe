# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that I created with React from the [official React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). The design is inspired by this [Dribbble](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/784413/screenshots/4426182/tic-tac-toe.gif), which you can check out more of the creator's work [here](http://yi-nie.com/index.html).
